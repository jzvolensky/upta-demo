Universal Public Transportation Application utilizing the Solid Pod technology. The initial release is available in the **experimental** branch. No features are currently working, but at least it looks nice so far!

## Overview
This application is being developed as a part of my master's thesis. The aim is to experiment with Solid Pods. The focus are is the Netherlands since the availability of data seems quite good so far. This application is an attempt at redefining the way public transport works. The idea is to use Solid Pods for managing and maintaining your own information securely. This is a **proof of concept**. Several features are planned to be included such as:

- Separate company and user login of the Pods into the system
- Obtaining a fake bus ticket (testing data transfers between pods)
- Some QoL features such as timetables and bus locations (if possible, awaiting data access permissions)
- A way to show GPS tracks captured from a phone on a map to see past journeys with costs included
